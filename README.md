### Paper Description:
We propose a robotic setup that uses the mixing to imitate mastication and tastes the dish at two different mastication phases. Each tasting is done using a conductance probe measuring conductance at multiple, spatially distributed points. This data is used to classify 9 varieties of scrambled eggs with tomatoes. We test four different tasting methods and analyze the resulting classification performance, showing a significant improvement over tasting homogenized samples. The experimental results show that tasting at two states of mechanical processing of the food increased classification F1 score to 0.93 in comparison to the traditional tasting of a homogenized sample resulting in F1 score of 0.55.
